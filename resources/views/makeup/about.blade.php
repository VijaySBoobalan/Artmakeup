            I'm a certified makeup artist, born and brought up

          <p class="about_p">
            I create simple and natural but notably elegant
					looks for my clients, and my biggest virtue lies
					in being open-minded to their suggestions. <br> <br>
					I believe that clarity of thought is important in
					the field of makeup. So I ensure that I communicate
					with my clients to understand  not just their desired
					look, but also their style& personality. <br> <br>
					My expertise passion  and zeal for makeup pushes me
					 to always deliver my best.

            Dismissing it as just a hobby, I decided to move forward with my graduate studies - until I deliberately failed an entrance paper as I realized was only trying to buy more time.
